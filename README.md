## Password Generator >>> JavaScript Challenge

## Technologies used and why.

For this project, I need to create a application that anyone can use to generate a random password based on criteria they have selected. This app will run in the browser but has a responsive layout for different viewports.

## Challenges for future improvement

During this project I had been trough challenges as searching online for the JavaScript functions and how to use them in order to have the best outcome. Using HTML and CSS interface, the power from JavaScript will give the function to the page.

## The Project

This challenge consists in creating a application to generate password:

- When clicks on the button to generate password, the user is presented with a series of pompts for password criteria
- The user can select which criteria to include in the password
- The user can choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 caracters
- When the page ask for character types to include in the password, th user shouyld confirm wheather or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- In the end the password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- When passowrd is generated, is either displayed in an alert or writter to the page
- When resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, is presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
- Extra: Added a clipboard buttom to make easier to copy the password generated
